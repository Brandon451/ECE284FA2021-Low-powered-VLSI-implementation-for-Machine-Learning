Please complete your sfp.v file in git's hw/w1/hw1/verilog/ path.

-In: 4-bit, out: 16-bit

-Control bits: acc, relu, reset

-If reset == 1, internal latch “psum_q” becomes zero

-If acc == 1, psum_q will be updated with “psum_q + In” in the next rising edge

-If relu == 1 and psum_q is negative number, psum_q will be updated to be zero in the next rising edge

-out port is just connected to the psum_q

 

-Sample vcd file is attached in git.

-sfp_tb.v file is also attached. Once you run sfp_tb.v file with your completed sfp.v file, the output waveform should be identical to sample vcd file.

-Attach your sfp.v file screenshot (no need to attach sfp_tb.v) and your completed waveform with either pdf or graphic files.
